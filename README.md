## Description:
An application that allows users to search through popular cocktails and click on cards, displaying a modal showing the ingredients and instructions for making each drink.  The user can also search drinks by name or ingredient, as well as add their own drinks to the site. Users may choose to pick a random cocktail as well.

## Approach Taken:

Bar None was built by creating 2 separate Github repositories - one for the front and and one for the backend. Once the backend was built out and tested by curling the routes in the terminal, the front end react app was fleshed out. The site began with rendering seed data for popular cocktails. Once the cocktails were rendered, the app was developed into full CRUD by allowing users to add their own cocktails and delete any cocktails added to the database. When a user clicks on a cocktail, a modal appears with information about that particular cocktail. Within this show page users are also able to mark a cocktail within the database as a favorite. A star will then appear on the corresponding card for that cocktail. 

In addition to the information in the database, Bar None accesses a 3rd party API, TheCocktailDB, to allow users to search for cocktails for inspiration. Users are able to search by name, ingredient, or click a button to retrieve a random cocktail from the API.
